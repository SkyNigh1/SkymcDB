# SkymcDB

**SkymcDB** is a tool designed for Minecraft builders, focused on generating block gradients, converting colors to blocks, creating pixel art, and generating Perlin noise-based patterns. It offers real-time previews, color-accurate results, and a modern interface.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Block Gradient Generator

Create smooth block gradients based on the average colors of block textures.

- Choose two blocks (from `top/` or `side/` textures)
- Select a distance (from 1 to 32 blocks)
- The algorithm interpolates colors and selects the closest matching blocks at each step
- Real-time preview of the generated gradient

> Ideal for creating seamless material transitions in your builds.

---

### 🧱 Color to Block Converter

Turn any color into the best matching Minecraft block.

- Choose a color using chromatic circle
- Select whether to match using `top/` or `side/` textures
- Instantly preview the closest matching block

> Great for stylized designs, palettes, or thematic builds.

---

### 🖼️ Image to Pixel Art Converter

Convert any image into a Minecraft block-based pixel art with accurate color matching.

- Upload an image of your choice
- Set the desired height (up to **512 blocks**)
- Select the texture perspective (`top/` or `side/`)
- Get a real-time preview of the pixel art built from real Minecraft blocks

> Perfect for murals, logos, or detailed wall art.

---

### 🌌 Perlin Noise Gradient Generator

Generate natural-looking noise-based patterns with a configurable gradient of blocks.

- Define the gradient (start block, end block, number of steps)
- SkymcDB interpolates the gradient and maps it onto the noise
- Live preview of the resulting pattern

> Useful for terrain detailing, procedural landscapes, or organic patterns.

## 🖥️ Interface

SkymcDB features a modern UI inspired by Discord's aesthetic, with intuitive panels and visual tools:
- Circular color picker like Blender's
- Real-time visualization
- Clean, dark-themed layout

---

## 📌 Note

SkymcDB is not intended to handle 3D formats like `.schem` or complex in-game integration like FAWE masks. It focuses on **2D block logic**, **visual design**, and **tool-assisted building**.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Expanded noise configuration
- Additionnal features
---

Made for builders, real artists.
