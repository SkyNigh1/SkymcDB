## Overview

**SkymcDB** is a tool tailored for **Minecraft builders**. It specializes in:
- color-to-block mapping,
- generating gradients (linear & bilinear),
- converting images into pixel art,
- and producing block-based visual patterns using procedural noise.

Its purpose is to **assist artistic construction** with real-time feedback, intuitive controls, and accurate color matching.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Color to Block

> Match any RGB color to the closest Minecraft block, using the **average texture color** of blocks.

- Choose a color using a chromatic circle
- Decide whether to match based on `top/` or `side/` block textures
- Instantly get a real block preview


---

### 🌈 Block Gradient Generator

Generate **smooth block gradients** using color interpolation.

- **Linear** gradient: between two blocks
- **Bilinear** gradient: between four blocks (forming a square)
- Distance customization (1–32 blocks)
- Accurate color-to-block matching at each step


---

### 🖼️ Pixel Art Generator

Convert any image into Minecraft pixel art.

- Supports images up to **512 blocks high** (8192 px)
- Choose `top/` or `side/` texture matching
- Real-time block preview
- Export as **PNG**

---

### 🌀 Pattern and Noise Generator

Create **procedural textures** using configurable noise.

- Supported types: `Perlin`, `Voronoi`, `Cellular`, and dynamic forms (e.g. spirals)
- Gradient mapping on noise
- Real-time preview of the result


---

## 🖥️ Interface

A modern interface, with intuitive tools and visuals:

- Circular color picker
- Clean dark-themed layout

---

## 📌 Note

SkymcDB does **not** support 3D exports like `.schem`, or complex in-game integrations (e.g. FAWE masks).  
It focuses purely on **2D visual design** and **tool-assisted building**.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Enhanced noise customization
- Additional block palette options
- More export formats

---

Made for builders. Made for artists.
